- If in the accessory.c accessory_receive_data() the funciton libusb_bulk_transfer() is called with a 64 byte buffer and
  in UartAccessoryText app I try to send more than 63 bytes none data is received by uartaccessory program. Looking with
  Wireshark seem system enter in a loop. I thought that using a little buffer the libusb_bulk_transfer require more calls
  but this isn't unfortunately.
  
  - I need to know actual transmission buffer and then send always packages < of this size ?
  - Can I assume a default of 64 bytes so it works for any type of USB connection ?
